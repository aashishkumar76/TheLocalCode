# TheLocalCode

## Introduction
The Local Code is specific news device focused at high schools as a way for students, teachers and parents to communicate and socialise.There are currently two issues with the current edge schools. Firstly, the schools often fail to utilize modern technologies to their fullest. Most, if not all high school students have a mobile device and they use it at school (whether they should be shouldn't be).They also often give out mobile device such as tablet computers to their students as a tool for learning but fail to use them to their fullest and are often ignored.Secondly the modern high school student often takes full advantage of social media and mobile computing while the school is often left behind. Most public schools primarily still underutilized computers.

Our answer for these two issues is mobile and web application which is practically similar to a mix of Blackboard and Facebook. It encourages correspondence of news things about and concerning the school amongst students and teachers. It also keeps parents informed and in the loop about their children's education.


## Concept
The idea is that a school which implements this app would give their students, their parents and teachers access to their school’s installation. Each class of user (student, teacher and parent) would have unique access to the service. Teachers would have the ability to post news about the school, particular courses, school events, etc. to a virtual news wall. These virtual walls would be displayed around the school on large screens which students would be able to see and interact with. Also, teachers have greater control and filter over news that has been posted by students. News that is posted by student which is of an inappropriate nature can be removed by teachers before it becomes forward facing in an attempt to prevent cyber bullying. 

Students can post their own news items and events on the wall under a different section. For instance, a group of students may want to post they are having a basketball game at lunch so that they can communicate this to their friends in different classes. The could also post about classes they take and share notes. Parents would have access to see what's being posted by teacher and students. They would also be able to receive direct news items from the school and/or teachers such as weekly newsletters.

The idea is that students would be able to use their own mobile devices in a constructive way at school or even just use school provided devices in a more meaningful way. It provides a safe and fast way for news to be passed around the school and makes use of already existing technologies. Parents are also kept aware of events that happen in the school and are thus better informed about their children's education.

### Why choose this over other apps?
1, Gives admins (i.e. school body) greater control over news, events, posts, etc.
2, Gives parents a new way to communicate with the school (i.e. they could have special accounts where the school could send weekly      newsletters, family events, etc)
3, Admin/school could post school wide news to students (new way to inform them in a healthy way).
4, Calendar feature where students can post local events (i.e. basketball game,for anyone to attend at lunch).
   Could have tags to filter student news after admin body approves.


## Team
The Local Code is comprised of four students in DECO3500. Our skills vary due have range of backgrounds and as a result all have unique skills, roles and jobs which best suit us.

Name | Course Code | Student No. | Email/Phone | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Farahida Hanim Mausor | DECO3500 | 43791695 | farahida.mausor@uqconnect.edu.au/ 0451 917 345 | Hi i am farah. Final semester of Master in Computer science ‘s student. As a computer science student being logic is a crucial when it come to developing algorithm and coding. In this project i am responsible to design the algorithm and ensure the system functionality works well. ……….
David Lawson | DECO3500 | 43195819 | david.lawson@uqconnect.edu.au/ 0466 236 077 | Hi so I’m David. I’m a fourth year IT student majoring in Computer System and Networks & User Design. My skills would likely tailor me towards backend/ under the hood design. As my major suggests I also offer skills when it comes to making things nice and usable from a front end point of view. I’m also responsible of <blank> in relation to this project.
Aashish Kumar | DECO3500 | 43881082 | aashish.kumar@uqconnect.edu.au/ 0416 220 173 | I am first year IT student majoring in software and User Interface Design. I will be focusing on design aspects of the project , Prototypes , Models and all the Vitual things in it. Will be leading the team hopefully to the successful project.

### Decision Making
When making decisions in the team a number of things need to be considered. Firstly, the impact of the decision must be taken into account. If the choice results in a large impact which affects the entire team and/or project, then the team should be notified via one of the communication channels outlined and the choices should be discussed. This applies to things such as the applications overall aim, concept changes, technology mediums, etc. 

If the decision being made is a small one such as trivial design choice and implementation methods which are associated with a ticket a team member is working on, then this is something the team member deals with him/herself. All choices will be reviewed at the end of the sprint to be marked off as complete.

### Conflict Resolution
Conflicts inevitably will arise when working with teams. Whether they are between a few or all team members and regardless of the topic a series of steps should be followed when dealing with them. These steps are outlined below.

Firstly, if an issue arises between team members they should attempt to resolve the issue as soon as possible themselves. If a resolution cannot be achieved, then other team members should be made aware and brought into the situation in an attempt to resolve the problem.

If a solution still cannot be achieved after this and additional time, the teaching staff should be made aware of the situation as soon as possible. This should be done to prevent further issues blocking the project.

## Communications
Communication for the project is done over a few different mediums depending on the situation.
* Facebook and Slack: used for general team discussion and communication. Facebook is the preferable platform for the team.
* Google Drive: used for collaborative document development and sharing. All things which dont belong in source control.
* GitHub: store source code for the project. Required by course.
* ZenHub: issue and ticket tracking. Required by course.

If urgent communication is needed and our instant messaging channels are not enough we have supplied our mobile numbers so that phone calls can be made. Email is also available if we need to send message which need to be saved and referred to later.

## Plan
__Planning Phase:__ Our plan is broken up into four phases. Firstly we have the research and planning phase. Here we will gather more detailed user requirements and create some initial designs. Our second phase is Low-Fidelity prototyping of our basic concept. This will allow for some fast feedback on our design concept. Our third phase is Digital prototyping. Here we will create digital designs mocking functionality. This prototype will allow us to learn more about our design. We will also design backend functionality in this phase which will support the front design. In our final phase we will deliver our final prototype. This will be a more detailed digital prototype mocking system wide functionality (rather than individual aspects).
