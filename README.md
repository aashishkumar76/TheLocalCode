# TheLocalCode

## Introduction
The Local Code is a specialised news tool targeted at high schools as a way for students, teachers and parents to better communicate and socialise. There currently exists two problems with the modern school. Firstly, the schools often fail to utilize modern technologies to their fullest. Most, if not all high school students have a mobile device and use it at school (whether they should be or shouldn’t be). They also often give out mobile device such as tablet computers to their students as a tool for learning but fail to use them to their fullest and are often overlooked. Secondly the modern high school student often takes full advantage of social media and mobile computing while the school is often left behind. Most public schools primarily still underutilize computers.

Our solution to these two problems is mobile and web application which is almost like a combination of Blackboard and Facebook. It facilitates communication of news items about and concerning the school between students and teachers. It also keeps parents informed and in the loop about their children's education.

## Concept
The idea is that a school which implements this app would give their students, their parents and teachers access to their school’s installation. Each class of user (student, teacher and parent) would have unique access to the service. Teachers would have the ability to post news about the school, particular courses, school events, etc. to a virtual news wall. These virtual walls would be displayed around the school on large screens which students would be able to see and interact with. Also, teachers have greater control and filter over news that has been posted by students. News that is posted by student which is of an inappropriate nature can be removed by teachers before it becomes forward facing in an attempt to prevent cyber bullying. 

Students can post their own news items and events on the wall under a different section. For instance, a group of students may want to post they are having a basketball game at lunch so that they can communicate this to their friends in different classes. The could also post about classes they take and share notes. Parents would have access to see what's being posted by teacher and students. They would also be able to receive direct news items from the school and/or teachers such as weekly newsletters.

The idea is that students would be able to use their own mobile devices in a constructive way at school or even just use school provided devices in a more meaningful way. It provides a safe and fast way for news to be passed around the school and makes use of already existing technologies. Parents are also kept aware of events that happen in the school and are thus better informed about their children's education.

## Team
The Local Code is comprised of four students in DECO3500. Our skills vary due have range of backgrounds and as a result all have unique skills, roles and jobs which best suit us.
